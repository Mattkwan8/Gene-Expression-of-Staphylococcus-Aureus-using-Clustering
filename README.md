# Gene Expression of Staphylococcus-Aureus using Clustering
This project analyzes gene expression data related to Staphylococcus aureus using dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to identify patterns among samples.

Data Preprocessing: Gene expression data is normalized and filtered to remove low-variance genes. Dimensionality reduction is performed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Clustering: K-Means Clustering divides samples into clusters based on PCA-reduced data. Provides insights into underlying biological differences based on similar gene expression profiles.

Visualization: Clusters are visualized using a scatter plot.

Next Step - Functional Analysis: Use top genes to uncover related pathways and molecular mechanisms using tools such as GSEApy
